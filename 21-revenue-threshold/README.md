OMG. We realized that we've made over a million dollars in 
revenue. Woot! Crud, we should have had a party ðŸ¥³ to celebrate.
Well, we're going to do that that now. But, out of curiosity,
we'd like to know on what day we should have held our party.
On what day did our total revenue (in the history of the company)
exceed $1M?
