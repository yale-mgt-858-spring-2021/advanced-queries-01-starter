OK! üëèüëèüëè

This is the first of a few "advanced queries" assignments. In each of 
these assignments there will be some warm up questions and then some
questions that will require using JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, and similar
methods. As ever, the teaching staff is on Slack to help you out. üòÅ

and then paste your repo URL [on the class website](https://www.858.mba/#assignments/advanced-queries-01).
